### Project Overview

Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, you will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data
analyst. You will work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, and meet different characters and team members. In order to answer the
key business questions, you will follow the steps of the data analysis process: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act**.
 
 
  
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of
marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your
team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will
design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your
recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

1. A clear statement of the business task
