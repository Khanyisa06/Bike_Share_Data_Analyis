# Bike_Share_Data_Analyis

Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study,I perform many real-world tasks of a junior data
analyst. I work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, and meet different characters and team members. In order to answer the
key business questions, I follow the steps of the data analysis process: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act**.

**The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.**
 
- I will work in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic , a bike-share company in Chicago as a junior data analyst .
- As a team we have to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
- From these insights, design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
- But first, Cyclistic executives must approve our recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### Business Task

The primary business task is to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. As a junior data analyst in the marketing team, the goal is to gather insights that will inform the development of a targeted marketing strategy. The overarching objective is to maximize the number of annual memberships(convert casual riders into annual members), as identified by the director of marketing. 

To achieve this, the data analysis process will be followed, encompassing key steps such as asking relevant questions, preparing and processing the data, conducting a thorough analysis, and ultimately sharing actionable insights. The success of the proposed marketing strategy hinges on obtaining approval from Cyclistic executives, necessitating the presentation of compelling data insights and professional data visualizations. The outcome of this analysis will not only address the immediate task of understanding user behavior but will also serve as the foundation for strategic decisions aimed at enhancing Cyclistic's future success in the bike-share market.


### Data Sources
- I  used Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. [Download the Cyclistic trip data here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
  
**Note:**
- The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company.
- For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriateand will enable you to answer the business questions.
- The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. [Under this license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)
- You can choose to work with an entire year of data, or just one quarter of a year.
- If you are working in Google Sheets, there are some files that might be too large to view.
- This is public data that you can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes.
- But note that data-privacy issues prohibit you from using riders’ personally identifiable information
